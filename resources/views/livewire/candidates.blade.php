                        <p>It’s time to find the opportunity that fits you!</p>
                        <p>Finding a rewarding job can be tough. While on the surface things might seem great there is always more to learn about a potential employer. Unfortunately, today’s system is set up so that you only find out about the good stuff during the interview phase. Only after you begin do you get exposure to the corporate culture which can be drastically different than what you thought it was. A classic case of buyer beware!</p>
                        <p class="pb-0">To be clear: not all organizations are bad. Most are great places to build a career. What truly matters, though, is whether your working style, core beliefs, and passions align with the opportunity. If not, then it may not be the right place for you.</p>
